        <h3>What's in Professor Oak's Mind</h3>
        <p>
            This Game is designed and developed by Qiwen Wang(currently), an undergraduate student in University of Illinois.<br>
            This game is designed for Microsoft ImageCup, 2016 Azure Cloud Challenge - University of Illinois.<br>
            It predicts players information, like age, mode, how good is he/she at playing games, etc, and then uses Azure Machine Learning to predict is he/she going to quit the game.<br>
            In order to keep potential players who want to quit, the game rewards them a masterball. (The master ball also appears in random situation.)<br>
            <br>
            Besides using Azure Machine Learning, the game is designed to be entertaining, engaging. and addicting.<br>
            It is easy to control by simply clicking SPACE, and have multiple levels that could be really challenging if you DON'T KNOW Professor Oak's mind.
